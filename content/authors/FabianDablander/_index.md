I began my academic journey in Graz, Austria, where I studied Psychology and Philosophy. Dissatisfied with both, I looked for a more formal way to study the human mind and behaviour and ended up in Tübingen, Germany, pursuing a Masters degree in Cognitive Science.

For my thesis, I stepped out the ivory tower academia can sometimes be and worked with a car company on evaluating artificial driver models in their traffic simulation. While that was fun, academia is fun too, and so I started a PhD at the Department of Psychological Methods, University of Amsterdam, in December 2017. Broadly speaking, I am working on topics related to Bayesian inference and testing, dynamical systems, causal inference, and time-series analysis.

Besides academic things, I'm thinking about how we can utilize people's quantitative skills for the social good. To that end, I co-founded [CorrelAid Nederland](https://twitter.com/CorrelAidxNL), [Data versus Corona & Strategies versus Corona](https://scienceversuscorona.com/), and am a co-organizer of [DataMission](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/DataMission-Data-and-Digital-Technology-for-Humanity/). From 2015 to 2018, I was editor at the Journal of European Psychology Students where we introduced Registered Reports early on.
