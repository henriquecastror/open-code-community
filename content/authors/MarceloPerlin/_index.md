  I recently published the revised second edition of my R book "Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R". See this <a href = "https://www.msperlin.com/blog/post/2021-02-28-afedr-revision-2021/">blog post</a> for more details.

I work as an associate professor of Finance at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), south of Brazil. Details about my past and current work are available in section [Publications](/blog/publication) and [Code](/blog/code). My CV is available as [pdf](/blog/files/cv.pdf) and [Lattes link](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3262699324398819). 

In this blog I will write about my CRAN packages and any other ideas about finance and R or research papers that I’m currently working on. The content, however, will be mostly about R.

Got a question? Fell free to reach me at [marceloperlin@gmail.com](mailto:marceloperlin@gmail.com).
