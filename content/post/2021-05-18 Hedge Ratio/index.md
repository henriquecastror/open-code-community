# Introduction
This is a series of short articles to discuss the tools to manage risk in the commodity markets using \emph{R}. My goal is to show how can we optimize the hedging strategy using commodities contracts - futures and options. 


## Forward-Spot relationship 
- The relationship between the forward  and the spot price, assuming no-arbitrage, can be describe as follows (@Geman2005):
\begin{align} f ^T (t) = S(t)e^{(r-y)(T-t)} \end{align} 
where $r$ is the continuously compound interest rate at instant t and maturity $T$, and $y$ is the convenience yield.

- We call backwardation when $(r-y) < 0$, the forward curve is a decreasing function of maturity.

- The contango sitaution is when $(r-y) > 0$, the forward curve is an increasing function of maturity.

### Extract the Soybean prices from Quandl
soy = Quandl("TFGRAIN/SOYBEANS")
soy_f = soy  %>%
  mutate(soy, Futures = soy$`Cash Price`-soy$Basis)
dd= soy_f[,c(1:2, 6)]

```

## Spread Futures vs Spot price
![Basis`](basis.png){width=50%}

- Let's assume the \texttt{Basis} as only the spread  between \texttt{Spot} and \texttt{Future} price.

- Supposing you want to hedge a Cash Price position (Spot) with a Future contract (F) in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). 


```{r }
### Build ggplot 
dd1= melt(dd,id=c("Date"))

dd1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=value,color=variable))+geom_line()+
  theme_wsj()+
   xlab(" ")+ylab(" ")+
   scale_colour_manual("", 
                      breaks = c("Cash Price", "Futures"),
                      values = c("Cash Price"="darkblue", "Futures"="red"))+
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 8, colour = "grey10"))

```

## Hedge Ratio
- The hedge ratio is a measure that compares a financial asset to a hedging instrument. The measurement indicates the risk of a shift in the hedging instrument. 
\begin{align} H^* = \rho \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_F} \end{align} 

\begin{align} H_{mv}= \frac{Cov(\Delta S_t, \Delta f_t)}{Var(\Delta f_t)} \end{align} (@Lien2016)

- In the commodity markets is common to use Futures contracts to hedge the Spot price. If a producers/exporters want to hedge their production, for example, then they would sell Futures contracts; if a buyers/importers want to hedge their position in the futures markets, then they would buy futures contracts. In this sense, the hedge ratio indicates the level of risk a producer/exporter are exposed. 


# Time series - zoo
data.z = zoo(dd[,-1], as.Date(dd[,1], format="%Y/%m/%d"))
S = data.z[,"Cash Price",drop=FALSE]
F = data.z[,"Futures",drop=FALSE]
# Estimating the returns
lS= diff(log(S))
lF=diff(log(F))
# Hedge Ratio
H = cov(lS,lF)/cov(lF)
stargazer(H, type = "text", title="Hedge Ratio", rownames = FALSE,
          colnames = FALSE)
```

- Now suppose a company/importer knows that it will buy 1,000,000 of      soybeans in one month. The soybean futures contract unit is 5,000/bushels. So, the number a futures contract (long position) the company will buy is...
```{r }
N = H*(1000000/5000) #buy 190 futures contracts
stargazer(N, type = "text", title="N of Contracts", rownames = FALSE,
          colnames = FALSE)
```

## Risk Metrics
### Estimating optimal hedging ratios based on risk measures (see @Chan2019)

- The risk manager's role is to mitigate the volatility by hedging the underlying asset or avoiding the deviation from the expected value.   
- There are a few risk metrics to measure the uncertainty in the futures contracts. @Chan2019 created a package that computes 26 financial risk measures. Thus, we applied the function to our example (soybean hedging).


### We use the Soybean Future contract (F) for hedging the Spot price (S)
rh = riskR::risk.hedge(lS,lF,alpha=c(0.05, 0.01), beta = 1, p=2)
stargazer(rh,type="text",font.size = 'tiny',
          no.space = TRUE, column.sep.width = '4pt', title="Risk Metrics")


```
