 abstract = {We show that the interest rate on Federal funds is extremely informative about future movements of real macroeconomic variables. Then we argue that the reason for this forecasting success is that the funds rate sensitively records shocks to the supply of bank reserves; that is, the funds rate is a good indicator of monetary policy actions. Finally, using innovations to the funds rate as a measure of changes in policy, we present evidence consistent with the view that monetary policy works at least in part through "credit" (i.e., bank loans) as well as through "money" (i.e., bank deposits).},

 abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of a monetary policy shock on the U.S. economy. Our measures of contractionary monetary policy shocks are associated with (i) a fall in various monetary aggregates and a rise in the federal funds rate, (ii) declines in different measures of real activity, (iii) sharp declines in commodity prices and a delayed decline in the GDP price deflator. In addition, net funds raised by the business sector increases for roughly a year, after which it falls. Finally, we find that households do not adjust their financial assets and liabilities for several quarters after a monetary shock.},

 abstract = {We develop a model-based, VAR methodology for measuring innovations in monetary policy and their macroeconomic effects. Using this framework, we are able to compare existing approaches to measuring monetary policy shocks and derive a new measure of policy innovations based directly on (possibly timevarying) estimates of the central bank's operating procedures. We also propose a new measure of the overall stance of policy (including the endogenous or systematic component) that is consistent with our approach.},

abstract = "This paper studies the monetary transmission mechanism using disaggregated industry data from five industrialized countries. Our goal is to document the cross-industry heterogeneity of monetary policy effects and relate it to industry characteristics suggested by monetary transmission theories. Sizable and significant cross-industry differences in the effects of monetary policy are found. Such differences swamp the hardly detectable cross-country variability. Sectoral output responses to monetary policy shocks are systematically related to the industry output durability, financing requirements, borrowing capacity and firm size. These findings are consistent with a quantitatively non-negligible role of financial frictions in the monetary transmission."

A similar investigation is conducted for the model containing a time trend.},

 abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series xt first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination $\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}$ is already stationary, the time series xt are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector α. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that α becomes a matrix. Interpreting $\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}=0$ as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

The author derives the likelihood ratio test for cointegrating rank and finds it asymptotic distribution. He shows that the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations can be found by reduced rank regression and derives the likelihood ratio test of structural hypotheses about these relations. The author shows that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian, allowing inference for hypotheses on the cointegrating relation to be conducted using the Chi(\&quot; squared\&quot;) distribution.
